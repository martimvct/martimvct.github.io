 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, AVG: 17/20                                           Sep. 2024 – Jun 2027

Experience
 Embedded Software Engineer, Rocket Experiment Division                                        Sep. 2025 – Present

    • Engineered C-based control software for a hybrid rocket filling station, replacing hazardous manual procedures

       with a 100m+ remote-controlled system, implementing a robust state machine, hardware watchdogs on a
       STM32, and SD-card data logging.
    • Developing a secure internal wiki using Docusaurus, Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Zero Trust, automating

       documentation via Doxygen2md to centralize mission-critical schematics, mitigate legacy errors and preserve
       legacy knowledge.
 Software Engineer, Técnico Investment Club                                                    Sep 2025 – Present

    • Architected a high-frequency trading engine in C++ optimized for resource-constrained hardware, with the goal

       of achieving sub-50ms tick-to-trade latency through custom lock-free data structures and a decoupled ”Trading
       Pod” architecture that ensures strategy-level isolation.
    • Developing the Trading Pod part of the trading engine, implementing an SPMC lock-free ring buffer to

       orchestrate market data consumption, strategy execution, and risk management and order execution via
       fire-and-forget.
    • Developing a monitoring sidecar in Go to ingest real-time telemetry (tick-to-trade, lock-free buffer saturation),

       automating daily health and portfolio reporting through Discord webhook integrations.
    • Optimized data visualization by migrating JavaScript calculations from the client to the server and

       implementing LTTB downsampling, reducing webpage load times by 75% while maintaining fidelity for 10k+
       data points.

Projects
 Library Management System | Java, OOP, Design Patterns                                     School Project, OOP
    • Designed a system handling entity relationships (Works, Users, Loans) with a focus on extensibility

      (Open-Closed Principle)
    • Implemented business logic for a dynamic user reputation system that automatically adjusts borrowing

      privileges and calculates fines.
